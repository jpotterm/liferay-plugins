# Server Manager User Guide

## Introduction

The Server Manager allows managing an application server running Liferay remotely. It follows a RESTful URL pattern, and specific functionality is documented below.

## Authentication

BASIC authentication is used for security, and you must authenticate before using any of the functionality of this plugin. The user must be a valid liferay Omni Admin.

## Request

Each url has a request type which is the type of the HTTP request (GET, POST, UPDATE, or DELETE), and arguments as specified. Square brackets '[]' denote optional arguments, and dollar signs '$' denote variable arguments. 

### Global Request Parameters

These parameters can be set on any GET request and are passed as GET parameters in the URL with ?name=value. If multiple values are possible they will be separated by a '|' and the first one will be the default value.

 - `format=json|raw` This specifies the format of the response. The default is a JSON response with an output, error, and status flag. If raw is set, however, the output is returned as a string, without its JSON wrapping.


### Monitoring Methods

GET <http://localhost/server-manager-web/status>

 - **Description:**       Successful if the server is up and running, otherwise this request fails.
